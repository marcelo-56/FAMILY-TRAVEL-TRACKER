INSTRUCTIONS: 
download all files and place them in a folder. inside that folder, create two folders called 'views' and 'public' and place the index.ejs file inside of the 'views' folder and the files ending with a '.css' inside of the 'public' folder. Those are the npm modules used:

express
pg
body-parser

once you've created the folders, go to the terminal and cd to the main folder (the big one containing all of the files and other folders). run 'npm i' on the terminal and then 'nodemon index.js'. That should run the app, available on localhost:3000. hope this helps you!
